title: 'Cryptocurrency disruption and investors reaction to earnings announcements'
summary: (with *Minjae Kim, Eva Liang* and *Xinyuan Shao*) </br>  <DIV align="justify"> In recent years, the capital market has witnessed a cryptocurrency mania. In this paper, we study the relationship between the cryptocurrency market and investor reactions to earnings news. Building on limited investor attention literature, we hypothesize that the cryptocurrency market distracts investors from earnings news. We measure the cryptocurrency distraction as the absolute value of two-week cumulative returns before earnings announcements, and find that the cryptocurrency distraction is associated with a weaker price reaction to earnings surprises. Our result is robust when using the Chinese ban on cryptocurrency as a source of exogenous variation in cryptocurrency prices. Consistent with the distraction hypothesis, we find that the cryptocurrency distraction effect is more pronounced when there is more information load, measured by the number of concurrent earnings announcements. To corroborate the finding, we further show that cryptocurrency distraction is associated with lower Google search volume and abnormal trading volume around earnings announcements. In addition, we document that cryptocurrency distraction effect is concentrated in retail trading rather than institutional trading, and consistently, is associated with more severe information asymmetry. Overall, our study provides evidence that cryptocurrency, a class of asset with no intrinsic value, disrupts information processing in the equity market. </DIV>

The figure presents the relation between Bitcoin price (BTC-USD) and google search volume for the term 'crypto'. It appears from the simple bi-ivariate analysis that investor demand for crypto is related to Bitcoin price. In this paper, we find that price movements in the cryptocurrency markets distracts investors and influence market's reaction to earnings announcements.
