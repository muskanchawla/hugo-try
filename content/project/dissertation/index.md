title: 'Delayed media coverage of earnings news: Evidence from cryptocurrency market'
summary: (*Dissertation*) </br> <DIV align="justify"> This paper examines how and to what extent financial media is affected by the events in cryptocurrency markets. Financial media responds to the rising demand for news about the cryptocurrency market by either delaying the news coverage or lowering the quality of the news articles. I find that the media reduces the coverage of earnings announcements on the crypto event days and increases the coverage of firms a few weeks after the event. This delay in media coverage is also evident on the day earnings are announced. To investigate the effect on the quality of news articles, I examine the content of the news articles. I show that, on the crypto event days, news articles are shorter and rely more on factual data, which may be a result of financial media allocating lower resources towards earnings announcement news articles. Last, I report the adverse capital market consequences of the mediaâ€™s focus on cryptocurrency events.   </DIV>

The figure shows the trend of substitution of earnings related articles with crypto related articles by Steven Russolillo, a senior journalist at The Wall Street Journal. If this pattern exists for major financial media outlets, it would have implications for equity markets. My job market paper examines the effect of cryptocurrency markets on information production function of financial media.
