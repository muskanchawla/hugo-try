title: 'Distracted financial media: Evidence from cryptocurrency market'
summary: (*Dissertation*) </br> <DIV align="justify"> I study how and to what extent financial media is affected by the advent of cryptocurrency markets. I find that media prefers to write about cryptocurrency events and decide to drop earnings announcements articles. This is attributable to higher news demand for cryptocurrencies than earnings announcements due to  the trending and controversial nature of cryptocurrencies. I then investigate the timing and content of the news articles about earnings announcement around cryptocurrency events. My results suggest that there is a delay in publishing earnings announcement articles on account of the distraction from events in the cryptocurrency market. Examining the text of the news articles, I observe that the word count and the amount of soft information in the earnings announcement news articles are lower on the crypto event days. Finally, I show the capital market consequences of media's distraction. Overall, my results shed light on how cryptocurrency markets have spillover effects on financial mediaâ€™s production function in the equity market. </DIV>

The figure shows the trend of substitution of earnings related articles with crypto related articles by Steven Russolillo who writes for The Wall Street Journal. If this pattern exists for major financial media outlets, it would have implications for equity markets. My job market paper examines the information production function of financial media. Specifically, I study how and to what extent financial media is affected by the advent of cryptocurrency markets.
