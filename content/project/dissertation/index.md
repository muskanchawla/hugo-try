title: 'Distracted financial media: Evidence from cryptocurrency market'
summary: (*Dissertation*) </br> <DIV align="justify"> This paper examines how and to what extent financial media is affected by the events in cryptocurrency markets. Using extreme cryptocurrency returns as a proxy for cryptocurrency events, I document that the media prefers to write articles about cryptocurrencies over earnings announcements. This can be attributable to higher news demand for cryptocurrencies than earnings announcements. However, this preference towards cryptocurrencies is temporary as there is an increase in a firm’s media coverage within three weeks of the cryptocurrency event. I also investigate the timing and content of the earnings news articles. I find that media takes longer time to publish earnings announcement news articles on the days of cryptocurrency events. Further, the articles are shorter and rely more on the hard information. This can be explained by the media being distracted by the cryptocurrency markets. Last, I report adverse consequences of media’s attention towards cryptocurrency events in the capital markets. Overall, my results shed light on how cryptocurrency markets have spillover effects on financial media’s information production function in the equity markets.   </DIV>

The figure shows the trend of substitution of earnings related articles with crypto related articles by Steven Russolillo, a senior journalist at The Wall Street Journal. If this pattern exists for major financial media outlets, it would have implications for equity markets. My job market paper examines the effect of cryptocurrency markets on information production function of financial media.
