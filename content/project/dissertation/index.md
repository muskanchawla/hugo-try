title: 'Delayed media coverage of earnings news: Evidence from cryptocurrency market'
summary: (*Dissertation*) </br> <DIV align="justify"> This paper examines how and to what extent financial media coverage is affected by events in cryptocurrency markets. I find that the financial media responds to the rising demand for news about the cryptocurrency market by either delaying earnings news coverage or lowering the quality of earnings news articles. On crypto event days, earnings news articles are shorter and rely more on quantitative data suggesting that fewer resources were allocated by media firms to earnings announcement news articles. Capital markets react less to earnings announcements as a result of the reduced coverage by financial media on crypto event days. Interestingly, media increases coverage of firm-specific events in the 30-day period after the crypto event to cater to the informational demand from equity investors. </DIV>

The figure shows the trend of substitution of earnings related articles with crypto related articles by Steven Russolillo, a senior journalist at The Wall Street Journal. If this pattern exists for major financial media outlets, it would have implications for equity markets. My job market paper examines the effect of cryptocurrency markets on information production function of financial media.
