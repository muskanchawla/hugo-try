<DIV align="justify"> Using realized earnings over long periods of time, we investigate errors in earnings expectations implied by stock prices of firms. We compute realized lifetime earnings for each firm starting at the IPO date and the beginning of each subsequent year and compare it to stock price on that date. Of the 16,386 firms examined, only 17% survived till 2019, 42% merged with other firms and the rest were delisted for other reasons. While the average lifetime earnings at the aggregate level slightly exceeds first day price, the results are driven by roughly 33% of the firms in the sample. Mergers account for most of success in recovering the first day stock price and appear to be the best way to generate enough earnings to justify valuations. Even among firms that survived, over 46% have yet to generate enough earnings to justify their first day valuations even though they have been in business between 15 and 45 years. Aggregate free cash flows over the lifetime of all firms are lower than the lifetime earnings and justify 80% of the first day trading price. We relate our paper to Bessembinder (2018) by examining the link between lifetime earnings (as a measure of fundamental wealth creation) and stock returns-based wealth creation. We find that lifetime earnings are positively associated with future returns-based wealth creation while current returns-based wealth created itself is negatively associated with future returns-based wealth creation. These results point to a disconnect between returns-based wealth creation and fundamental wealth creation in the short to medium term that eventually corrects.   </DIV>

The distribution of the ratio of lifetime earnings per share to stock price is shown in this figure. We compute every firm's discounted value of lifetime earnings on the first trading day and scale it by the stock price on that day. The observations to the left of red line at one had lifetime earnings lower than their stock price. We find that for more than two thirds of the firms which started trading after 1975 could not generate enough earnings over their lifetime to justify their first day trading price. Of the one thirds, mergers accounted for 71% of the success due to the merger premium paid to shareholders at the time of mergers. This depicts the errors between the earnings expectations of the market and the reality over long periods of time.
