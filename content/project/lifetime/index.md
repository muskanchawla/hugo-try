title: 'Lifetime earnings'
summary: I study how and to what extent financial media is influenced by the advent of cryptocurrency markets. Prior research shows that financial media influences investors, managers and institutions but their production function is not well understood in the literature. I find that media prefers to write about cryptocurrency events and decide to drop earnings announcements articles. This is attributable to media’s propensity to cover new topics of interest by investors. This effect appears to fade away as the time passes by. Potential gain and loss of readership influences this relation. Smaller alt coins which will not get much readership do not influence earnings announcement coverage by media. Overall, my results provide evidence on how cryptocurrency markets have spillover effects on financial media’s role in capital markets.

Abstract: Using realized earnings over long periods of time, we investigate errors in earnings expectations implied by stock prices of firms. We compute realized lifetime earnings for each firm starting at the IPO date and the beginning of each subsequent year and compare it to stock price on that date. Of the 16,386 firms examined, only 17% survived till 2019, 42% merged with other firms and the rest were delisted for other reasons. While the average lifetime earnings at the aggregate level slightly exceeds first day price, the results are driven by roughly 33% of the firms in the sample. Mergers account for most of success in recovering the first day stock price and appear to be the best way to generate enough earnings to justify valuations. Even among firms that survived, over 46% have yet to generate enough earnings to justify their first day valuations even though they have been in business between 15 and 45 years. Aggregate free cash flows over the lifetime of all firms are lower than the lifetime earnings and justify 80% of the first day trading price. We relate our paper to Bessembinder (2018) by examining the link between lifetime earnings (as a measure of fundamental wealth creation) and stock returns-based wealth creation. We find that lifetime earnings are positively associated with future returns-based wealth creation while current returns-based wealth created itself is negatively associated with future returns-based wealth creation. These results point to a disconnect between returns-based wealth creation and fundamental wealth creation in the short to medium term that eventually corrects.
