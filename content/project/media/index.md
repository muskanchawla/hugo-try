title: 'The media goes where it is needed: The relation between the investor base and media coverage'
summary: The figure shows the difference between media coverage of treatment and control firms before and after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2017 (TCJA). Treated firms are the firms affeced by the amendment in section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code. TCJA 2017 amended the section to limit the interest deduction in the computation of taxable income to the sum of 30% of the taxable income and interest income. The figure suggests that there was an increase in media coverage for the firms which reduced their leverage due to TCJA. This is consistent with the main finding of the paper that financial media caters more to monitoring demand by equity investors than debt investors who are involved directly in monitoring the firms.

**Abstract** </br> We provide evidence that a firm’s investor base is a key factor in determining its media coverage. Using a large sample of U.S. public companies spanning the period 2000-2019, we find that firm-specific media coverage is negatively associated with leverage. Our results suggest the media caters relatively more to equity investors, who largely rely on public information, than to debt investors, who are often privy to privileged information. We arrive at similar conclusions when we exploit plausibly exogenous changes in investor base and investor access to privileged information. Among debt investors, the media appears to cater to public bond holders more than private banks. Among equity investors, the media appears to cater to quasi-index institutions. Additionally, cross-sectional variation in media coverage based on investment and article types reveals that the media’s role is far more nuanced than previously documented. Overall, our findings suggest that financial media coverage is significantly influenced by less sophisticated professional investors’ demand for information to help monitor firms.
